I've always hated Sesame Street. I never let my kids watch it. I speculated, and had my instincts confirmed, that it created an expectation that "learning" would involve songs, puppets, and create sociopathically short attention span. On entering the government school system, children were "bored." School bureaucrats decided that education had to be edutainment. Thus began the devolutionary spiral down to what has become a state-sponsored childcare service with political and social indoctrination.
