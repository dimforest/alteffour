# Cylance uninstall tool
Alright, the "customized" one is the one I've had the most luck with.

Sometimes I'll have to run it a couple times. Sometimes it won't work at all. Sometimes I'll have to first go and kill Cylance in the system tray, run the script, THEN go and manually uninstall from appwiz.cpl and other times I can remotely run the script against a group of PCs and it'll work.

It's inconsistent, unfortunately... but that's due largely in part to Cylance being Cylance.
